# ComposeRNN
use a simple RNN to compose music

steps:

0. get a midi file
1. decode midi file and paste result into the text file read by the RNN
2. copy-paste the output of the RNN to the midi player (as list)

There are two versions: the first just uses notes, the second also adds velocity and time. Overall a bit unpolished, but some really nice sections result from e.g. Bach - Wohltemperiertes Klavier.
